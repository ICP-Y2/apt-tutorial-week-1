## Learning Logs - Tutorial 1 

When you are learning something new, it is easy to forget what you already studied.
For example, while learning programming or any technical subject, you may read many
resources and try many examples.

A **Learning Log** helps you:
- Keep track of topics you are learning
- Write down what you learned about each topic
- Review your learning later

This project helps you build a simple system to organize learning in one place.
